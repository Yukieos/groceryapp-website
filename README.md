# ðŸ›’ GroceryApp Website

This is the front-end of my grocery price comparison application.

Users can take or upload images of grocery items to get the best price nearby. The app connects to a backend API that classifies items using a MobileNetV3 model and EasyOCR, then returns matched prices from a PostgreSQL database.
